My name is Ives Xue, and my current majors are Applied Mathematics and Economics. I like to combine what I have learnt in class to practical uses, and I really enjoy inter-discipline research. Theories are fun for me, but practical uses are the true reasons behind my major choices. I am discovering research areas that I might be interested in. Now my top choices are biostatistics, causal inference and dynamic systems.
