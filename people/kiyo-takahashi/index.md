Hello! My name is Kiyo Takahashi. I am a senior majoring in Applied Statistics and double minoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am interested and curious about data science and am using this opportunity to learn more about research and see if this is a future career path for me. Outside of class, I enjoy being involved in my campus ministry, cooking, and crocheting.
