Hello! My name is Sophia Fang. I am a junior double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics, minoring in Japanese. I am passionate about interdisciplinary studies, which not only allows me to continuously acquire new skills, but also allows me to utilize the knowledge from my major to solve problems in a variety of fields in the real world.
Outside of class, I enjoy playing piano, cooking, and traveling. My next destination is (hopefully) Czechia.
