Hello! Thanks for visiting my page. I'm enrolled in a combined B.S./M.S. in Neuroscience program.

I'm extremely excited to work with Dr. McGowan for my undergraduate honors thesis. We're developing tools in R to streamline behavioral data collection and processing in the social and biological sciences.

My master's thesis is supervised by [Dr. Kishida](https://school.wakehealth.edu/Faculty/K/Ken-T-Kishida), and we are studying the neurobiology of decision making under uncertainty.

Some (not so) fun facts about me:

-   I'm from Orlando, FL, and I get asked if I go to Disney a lot more times than I've been to Disney.
-   I like going to the gym to pick things up and put them down again.
-   I enjoy reading and sleeping, though not at the same time.
-   I'm a sushi lover (and chef) who is slightly concerned about consuming too much mercury.
