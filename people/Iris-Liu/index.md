subtitle: "Undergraduate Research Assistant, URECA Scholar"
---

I am a Junior double major in Mathematical Statistics and Studio Art. I am keen on applying my skills and experience in these two areas to solve problems analytically and creatively.

I did a URECA research project mentored by Dr. McGowan during this summer. We helped the Reynolda House Museum of American Art manage, analyze, and visualize their data.

Besides data, I am passionate about wilderness adventure, sustainability, and fine art.
