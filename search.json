I’m thrilled to work with Dr. McGowan’s Data Science Lab on developing the best practices to teach R in both a classroom and online setting using a randomized controlled trial. As a research assistant, I’ve helped build the interactive tutorials on using tidyverse for data analysis and create the randomized trial using shiny and learnr software tools.\nI’m excited to apply my mathematical and coding skills in using big data and technology to solve real-world problems. Overall, my goal is to gain more experience in data science and help develop technological advances to improve other’s quality of life.\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nR programming\nMathematics\nData Science\nData science pedagogy\nShiny\n\n\n\n\n Education\nWake Forest University\nB.S. in Applied Mathematics and Minor in Computer Science, 2021"
