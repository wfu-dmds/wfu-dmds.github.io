Hello! I am an undergraduate at Wake Forest University, double majoring in Mathematical Business and Philosophy. I’m thrilled to work with Dr. McGowan on my senior year thesis, “NBA Player Clustering Using Gaussian Mixture Modeling”. 

I am passionate about utilizing data to improve the product of sports at both a team level and a league level. I additionally have interests in healthcare data science and hope to pursue a career in data science in either health care or sports. After graduating from Wake Forest, I plan to pursue a Master’s in Data Science from the University of Virginia. 

Outside of the classroom I enjoy hiking, watching sports, running, cooking, playing with my dogs, and serving in my church.
